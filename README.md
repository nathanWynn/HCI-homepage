## Synopsis

Schools are having a hard time adapting to remote life. 

For younger kids, it's easy to get distracted, demotivated or depressed because of the lack of social interaction. Children rely on context cues and social interaction to succeed academically and socially, and the existing virtual education ecosystem leaves many students at a disadvantage.

We propose a solution to virtual learning for younger students that **reduces** anxiety, **fosters** a social environment, and **engages** students in an interactive virtual environment by using existing, popular, moddable online video games as a **platform for education**.
